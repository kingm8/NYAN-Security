/* ********************************************
 
    This is the header file for the Cryptography module. This module is responsible for the encrypting and decrypting user data in as secure and
    efficient a fashion as possible. The encryption and decryption functions themselves utilize the XOR operator, a bitwise operator.
    The XOR operator lends itself to easy reversibility as it only needs to be applied once more after encryption to succesfully decrypt.
    This header file also specifies functions that serve to encrypt and decrypt the contents of an entire linked list.
